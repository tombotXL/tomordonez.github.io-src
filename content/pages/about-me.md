I took Neural Networks before it was hot. Worked in a signal processing lab with other mad scientists. Wrote code in Java. Managed engineering projects. Managed marketing projects. Built websites and apps. I have been to CES, Pycon, Rubyconf, Sourcecon and other large conferences. I spend most of my free time drinking tea and learning tech.

Inspired by the Open Source Data Science Masters by Clare Corthell. I am taking my own MS in Data Science using Coursera, Udemy, books, Stackoverflow and open source tools.

## My current tools are:

* Fedora Linux
* R
* Python
* PostgreSQL
* AWS
* Tableau

## I am following this iterative process:

* **Input**: Get data, process data
* **Engine**: Analysis, modeling, development
* **Output**: Prototype, report, loop.

This website is now focused on my quest to conquer data science.
