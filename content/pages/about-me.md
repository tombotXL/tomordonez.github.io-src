Worked in a signal processing lab with other mad scientists doing neural networks. Wrote code in Java. Managed engineering projects. Managed marketing projects. Built websites and apps. I have been to CES, Pycon, Rubyconf, Sourcecon and other large conferences. I spend most of my free time learning tech and playing the electric guitar.

I am on a quest to learn data science while building teams with awesome leaders.

## My current tools are:

* Fedora Linux
* Python
* PostgreSQL
* AWS
* Tableau


This website is a "Sopa de Letras" (alphabet soup) about Linux, data science, marketing, growing teams and whatever comes to my mind at the moment.
