Summary: There is more than Google or Bing. Try these unusual search engines for sourcing.

We all know the usual suspects: Google, Bing, and Yahoo. Is that it? Are those the only options?

Let's try these unusual search engines for sourcing:

## Wolfram Alpha
https://www.wolframalpha.com

As shown on the footer of the home page. A submitted query goes through natural language understanding, pulls results from curated data and knowledge, and runs through a dynamic algorithmic computation; resulting in a computed visual presentation.

Didn't get it? Let's try an example.

Enter the query: `python engineer`.

The result has these sections:

Input interpretation:

* computer software engineers
* people employed
* United States

Sub-specialties:

* computer software applications engineers
* People employed: `495,500`
* Mean wage: `$90170 per year`

Other sections have this data:

* Related occupations
* Standard occupational classification `SOC code`

Let's try another query. Start typing this: `number of`. It shows these suggestions:

* number of English speakers
* number of hours in 7 weeks
* number of partitions of 1250
* number of homes in Denver
* number of galaxies

Try the query: `number of accountants in Chicago`:

* Input interpretation: `accountants and auditors`, `people employed`, `Chicago-Naperville-Joliet`
* 32880 people
* Yearly change: `-13%`
* Median wage: `$64560`

I actually had a hard time coming up with natural queries. The website has a page with <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/examples/" target="_blank">examples</a>. You can select a topic and get some ideas of queries that you can submit.

## 2lingual
https://www.2lingual.com

With this search engine you can search in 2 languages at the same time. Why would you need this? I thought about it too.

I set the options to search pages written in English and Spanish.

Then I used the query: `hadoop engineer`.

It shows two columns of results. English on the left. Spanish on the right.

A lot of interesting results on the right:

* 'Big Data, lo que todo ingeniero deberia saber': https://masqueingenieria.com
* 'Trabajo ingeniero hadoop': https://www.jobatus.es/
* 'Ofertas de empleo Hadoop en Barcelona': https://www.jobfluent.com
* 'ingeniero hadoop hive spark python': https://co.linkedin.com

In one of these results I found a long list of users.

## BizNar
https://biznar.com/biznar/desktop/en/search.html

A search engine to crawl the deep web. Information not crawled by your typical search engine:

* academic information
* scientific reports
* social media
* other resources not crawled by Google or Bing.

Let's try this query: `hedge fund manager`

The results page has a variety of filters:

* Topics
* Author
* Publications
* Source
* Dates
* Document format

I clicked on the 'Authors' drop down. It shows at least 100 authors. I selected one of these and it showed my two results. One of them said `IDC FutureScape: Worldwide Payments 2017 Predictions`. I went to this result and it opened a page describing an abstract from multiple authors. Some of their titles: `Research Director Worldwide Blockchain`, `Research Director Consumer Banking`, `Associate VP Financial Insights`.

Back on the full list of results. I filtered by `2019`, by `Document type: Blog`. The results now show only from Forbes. However, each result description contains a lot of information about hedge funds and managers.

## millionshort

This search engine is described as discovering sites that don't make it to the top of results for whatever reason.

The search field has the text `what haven't you found?` and the filter options are:

* Don't remove any sites
* Remove top 100 sites from results
* Remove top 1000 sites from results
* Remove top 10k sites from results
* Remove top 100k sites from results
* Remove top million sites from results

This looks very interesting. Let's try this query: `python engineer` with filter `remove top million sites`.

The results now have more filter options on the left side:

* Ecommerce: Remove or display ecommerce results
* Chat: Remove or display sites with chat
* Date, location

On the right side it has a list of sites removed from results, including the usual Google results: indeed, glassdoor, etc.

A lot of interesting results:

* https://www.pythonforengineers.com/
* https://www.python-engineer.com/
* https://www.remotepython.com/
* https://www.pythonjobs.com/
* https://networkchuck.com/python/

One of these caught my attention. It has a directory of about 1,000 Python developers.

It looks like Google and Bing aren't the only options. Perhaps you can try something new.
