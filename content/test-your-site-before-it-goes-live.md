This is a very interesting tool to preview your site before it goes live.

I have been using this tool when migrating sites from one hosting to another.

<a href="http://hosts.cx" target="_blank">hosts.cx</a>

You need to enter:

* New server IP address
* Website name.

You will get a URL.

When you preview the site some things might not display correctly, such as images, since they are cached.
